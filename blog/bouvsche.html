    <p>Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel. Welcome to Nina's Chelsea corner if you're new around here and welcome
        to my match review of Bournemouth Neil Chelsea Neil. You know the phrase that's 90 minutes of my life I'm never
        getting back. It's never been more suited to a game I've ever watched. I mean honestly was that even a football
        game? I mean it doesn't get any more dire than that. And you know what? Sometimes you see goalless draws where
        actually there's a bit of fight. There's a bit of intrigue. there's some excitement and things happen. Literally
        nothing happened except we saw Chelsea just struggle to play football again after such a big week against
        Barcelona and a draw against Arsenal with a great performance. How do we honestly fall so low to lose to leads,
        mind you, a very spirited lead side who'd played very well. I don't want to take anything away from them. Just
        drawn to Liverpool 3-3 as well. What a fight back. But to then react to that defeat by playing out the game we
        did against Bournemouth today is just astonishing in the worst connotations of the words because what on earth
        was that? Chelsea I I I actually am struggling to even justify what that was. But at some point guys I was
        literally just looking on my phone. I was speaking to my dad and my brother and my mom and we were just
        literally having conversations. And I never tend to do that during Chelsea games. I'm locked in. I'm drawn into
        what I'm watching. But there was just nothing about that, nothing about that game that made me want to watch.
        Um, so very dire. Bournemouth were better in the first half. Chelsea were better in the second half. Yet there
        was nothing from either side to show. On another day, Bournemouth probably win. But maybe so do we with a really
        scrappy win, one of the chances we had. But honestly, Robert Sanchez kept us in the game. Probably why we got a
        clean sheet. If anything, some good stops. Um, but overall just all over the place. really didn't look like we
        were interested in that. And that's an issue because I spoke about turning up in the big games. We tend to do it
        fine, but it means really nothing when you can't go on a run. Here you are, you're talking of coming uh off the
        back of a comprehensive 3-0 win, drawing to Arsenal, find a man down, then losing to leads, then drawing again.
        This isn't a sustainable way to play if you want to be pushing up the likes of the title contending teams, which
        we were considered 5 minutes ago, but it's not great. We are now fourth. We're five points behind Aston Villa
        who beat Arsenal today. We had a natural opportunity to capitalize on that to put ourselves further up as well.
        Instead, we didn't do that. Instead, we pushed ourselves further down. We're just a point ahead of Everton, who
        we play very soon. So, again, we just almost like to complicate life for ourselves. And yeah, but let's talk
        about the lineup, how we set up. I think quite as expected. I didn't think Estal would start this one. Um he has
        had a run of games and well runner games he wouldn't start three games in a row ever really at the minute. Um so
        that was expected. We had Garnacho there in the lineup. No Joel Pedro either today. Liam Dilap instead leading
        the line. Uh midfield obviously we had Reese alongside Enzo Fernandez with Malagusto who was expected to start
        since he also didn't against leads. But yeah other than that pretty much as expected. Um, in terms of setup, I
        think I'm most disappointed and obviously we know he's injured now, but Liam Dilap's performances have been so
        subpar since he's returned. Just the way that he's not able to control the ball closely and you can almost see
        that he's trying so hard to prove a point and to to get good because his time is ticking. You know, we envision
        Liam Dilap to be this guy that would get at least 15 goals this season. um or maybe delusional for thinking so
        uh at least Pedro rather but neither look on um on path to do that right now but dilap very disappointing just
        looked like he was losing his head a little bit he was frustrated with himself but honestly it was just a very
        subpar performance obviously really really unfortunate to lose him out to injury now we don't know how long that
        injury is going to be for so hopefully it's not ages and ages because the more he sidelines and the more he's in
        and out, the less we can actually uh build his confidence and get him sort of chem like forming chemistry with
        our other players. It's even hard to talk after that one, guys. Um, so yeah, obviously front line I thought very
        disjointed again. We were misplacing passes. We just couldn't get into the game and I thought, all right, maybe
        it's just going to take a little bit of getting into. We just never really got into that game either, guys. I
        was still saying minute 60, we're going to get into it. we're going to start creating something here. But it was
        just so dire. There was really no intent moving forward. It was very sloppy at times on transition. We we by the
        way look terrible on transition. We'd have an opportunity to counter and Netto or Garnacho whatever time would
        have the ball on the wing pace down and then just stop it and then pass it back into James or Gusto or Chalabar
        or anyone but a frontline player. So it was very very disappointing. And Cole Palmer again didn't quite look
        like himself. He's back from an injury. We know he's might he might need time. Like in our heads, Cole Palmer is
        just a superhero who can never be unfit when he is back and that's just not the reality at the minute. But we'll
        give him some time. I thought it just really wasn't clicking for us today. But it was disappointing to see that
        attitude, guys. It really, really was. So, um, not great overall. And again, it's like you can't be a consistent
        team if this is how you go about your run of results. It's just not a sustainable way to play and it's just
        simply not good enough. So yeah, there is really nothing much to say, guys. I don't even want to waste your
        time. You already wasted 90 minutes watching that. Um, and there's really no analysis for that one. It's just
        disappointing because we like until when do we keep going like this? We want to go on a bit of a run and we
        can't. We're halted every time we try to. So great you can turn up in the big games, but it means nothing if you
        can't beat opposition that we're dropping points to and it's truly a bit concerning now. I'd love to hear your
        thoughts. Um if you have any that is um it's a game to forget certainly it is a game to forget. We had a nil nil
        not long ago. I think it was in 2023 or something. Was that in our bad season? But yeah, just goalless and
        lifeless and dire and every horrible negative word I can say about that game. So yeah, that's enough from me,
        guys. Not much to say. I usually yap and yap and yap. You guys know that, but I have nothing else to say. That's
        it. Anyways, guys, like this video, subscribe to the channel if you haven't done so already. Please let me know
