        Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel. Welcome to Nina's Chelsea corner. If you're new around here and welcome
        to my match review looking at leads three, Chelsea 1. Yeah, that's right. Lead three, Chelsea 1 away at Ellen
        Road. Where to even begin with this one after such a big week beating Barcelona 3-0 at home. Could have been
        six, could have been seven, we said. An absolutely phenomenal display followed by a very good performance
        against Arsenal at Stamford Bridge on Sunday down to 10 men for an hour. Held our own should have also probably
        won and then we decide to top that week off with a loss to leads away. Now, when you're talking about
        challenging for the title, when you're talking about wanting to be a team who contends and competes at the top,
        you absolutely cannot lose these games in the fashion that we did as well. You know, I totally understand in the
        Premier League, we have all the surprises in the world, but when you make it that easy for a team, what what
        should you expect? And of course, the ultimate focus here is going to be on Chelsea. But before I absolutely
        condemn that performance, let me give a shout out to Leads because they deserve it. They outplayed Chelsea. Not
        over one half, not over the second half, over the course of the 90 minutes. Outplayed. Chelsea did not turn up
        today. And we were second best last night rather. And we were second best to leads in every aspect of the pitch.
        We just looked like we didn't really want to turn up. We looked like, you know what, it's been a tough week,
        boys. Let's relax. Take this one slow. Maresca's rotated us, so it should be a bit of a training drill. We
        should be uh just having a little bit of a play around. And no, that's not how it works. It's December. We have
        such a difficult run and it's such a disappointing um result, but also just a turn up because you cannot
        possibly tell me that this is where consistency is going to come from. Couple weeks ago, you guys all know the
        video on Sky Sports, me saying that Burnley scares me more than Arsenal and Barcelona. And here we are. We're
        struggling against lower level of opposition. And by that quote, I literally quite meant we seem to have the
        mentality to turn up in the big games, but that means nothing if you can't continue and be consistent with that
        run and beat the teams who are newly promoted into the Premier League. Um, you know, you look at the loss to
        Brighton, you look at the loss or rather dropping points to Brenford, you look at the loss to Sunderland at
        home, and these are all games that at some point you have to look at them and think there is no excuse for you
        to drop points in that manner. And it's just a real shame because I thought we could finally get into a bit of a
        a bit of a high with momentum, but actually the most disappointing thing about last night is the fact that
        Chelsea just did not turn up. Didn't look interested. Mistakes all across the park. I honestly if they were on a
        p like a competition of who made the worst mistake obviously one man would come out on top and we'll talk about
        it later but they all collectively would have had a a shout because every single player misplaced the pass did
        something wrong so while of course the highlight would be toen's error for the third goal that was absolutely
        horrific true however every single other player just did not pull their weight last night and it was really
        disappointing to Losing the ball in key areas, misplacing passes, too slow ball bouncing off shins, knees, legs,
        heads, shoulders, everywhere, but close control and touches. It was just a mess. It was really, really a mess,
        guys. So, anyways, the rant. The rant is over. Let's try and talk about this chronologically and figure out what
        went wrong, how we got there, um, in the end because, sorry, Enz Marissa did hint that we would see rotation. We
        knew Moyes Sky would be suspended following his red cards against Arsenal. Rhys James also needed a rest. We had
        Pedro Netto resting on the bench. But uh the back line in terms of the consistency is where again we fall short.
        We've seen that where we've paired Chalaba and Farna for most games. We've managed to to work quite well. But
        where you rapidly sort of change the back line like that, that's where it goes wrong. Badia Shaw and Toen coming
        into the lineup. Haven't seen them in a while. And to be honest, we don't really favor them that highly in terms
        of bad and toen for me are both squad players. And when you talk about the drop off in quality with what we've
        seen perhaps from Pana and Chalaba in the recent few games where they've played well together, it's quite stark.
        The difference is quite stark and you saw it. So questions were raised about why Josh Aching Pong didn't get a
        look in. He's someone who hasn't been involved but has had enough games and minutes um with good performances
        backed up by that to warrant him some game time in a game like that. For me and for most Chelsea fans, let me
        know what you guys think. Josh Hatchen was an obvious choice in this game. We saw Andre Santos start in midfield
        as well. Of course, we knew that was coming. He had a good performance against Burnley and we thought he he'd
        build on that. But to be honest, Santos disappointed me last night. Enzo Fernandez struggled. There was just no
        control in that midfield whatsoever. The leads every single time they picked the ball up in those key areas in
        midfield. They were just sprinting down and I thought every single time they went forward they could have
        scored. Seriously, that's just how dangerous how much grit that is how we played against Barcelona and Le just
        gave us a taste of our own medicine a week later. So, it's just really really disappointing to see the lapses of
        concentration and just very much losing the basics of football. just the simple basics of football. We're not
        even talking about massive expectations here. We really struggled to play football out there last night, guys.
        It was really, really that bad. Um, so yeah, in terms of the setup, I think raised eyebrows from the getgo, but
        you understood that Moresca needed to make changes. Rhys James obviously needs a rest as well. He's been playing
        um maybe a little bit too much and in quite physical games as well. always had a tough week but a brilliant one
        nevertheless. So I don't know maybe his involvement would have been welcome especially uh when you look at the
        fact that you know you have such a a high intensity lead side coming at you pressing at you constantly we needed
        a little bit of control there and we didn't have it control left chat in terms of the front lineto obviously uh
        given a rest he's someone who's been playing frequently has very made a case to be Enzo Moresca's most highly
        favored winger and for good reason. I understand. Uh Estal of course got a start which was brilliant to see
        though I must say there wasn't really much we saw although he has a couple passes and he was trying things
        trying to unlock uh the defense a little bit but there was a very needless yellow that he got if you guys
        remember and that just came as a a moment of inexperience you'll see with the rage and the brief bad decision um
        of making that foul um and we saw Jal Pedro of course start behind Liam Dap So again, the two of them have been
        underwhelming. They haven't quite hit the ground running together as a partnership. I know Liam Dilap's been
        out, but what I saw from Liam Dap was again this very very erratic uh presence on the ball where he struggled to
        take his first touch. Well, he almost was playing like he was trying too hard to point to prove a point and it's
        like he's already behind on what's an expected I guess goal tally of him for this season. So, it was quite
        disappointing to see. Everything he pretty much did was uh the wrong decision. It was over hit, under hit. He
        had a chance as well, which I think was actually created by Jo Pedro maybe in the second half and he just didn't
        quite manage to get it right. Um so really really underwhelming. We did nothing. We had I mean how many shots on
        target did we have? I need to check that because I think by the one goal we scored there must have been maybe
        another two at max. Am I wrong for saying that? I'll check my stats. I'll look it up, guys. But yeah, so
        obviously across the park, really poor. Really, really poor. Um, so let's talk about the goals and how the game
        unfolded because we conceded in minute five and that's um that's truly disappointing to concede so early on in
        the game uh where you know they will absolutely eat you up after that in the hostile environment they'll make
        after going one n up. Four defeats in a row. Four league defeats in a row and Chongy came to save the day.
        Helped save Christmas. We handed out another gift. However, wasn't even a gift. Honestly, Leads deserved it in
        the end. Absolutely did deserve it. I don't want to take away anything about their performance. I am just all
        about how badly Chelsea played and of course we did, but also leads actually put on a brilliant performance. So,
        they deserve credit for that, I have to say. But we concede at minute five um no one seems to be marking anyone.
        I think Liam Dilap is the one to lose his man and we concede um very early on and that just shifts the whole
        dynamic because leads just continue to do what they were doing in the opening five minutes. Press hard, force
        out errors, uh make us look nervous on the ball and then it didn't take long until before Halime to Naka scored
        an absolutely brilliant goal as well. It's a great finish, mind you. But how did he get into that situation
        again? Yeah, poor. Enzo Fernandez, I don't know what he is doing there. I mean, it's just really, really poor.
        Defense is asleep. Obviously, didn't expect that to happen. And uh yeah, Tanaka just fires at home for 2-0. And
        there we are. We're down 2-0 down at Halime. And still, there's a little part in me that thinks after Halime
        that we come out in this and we substitute on Cole Palmer. We change the front line a little bit, have them
        bring some more energy. Leads maybe drop off is what I was telling myself. But no, that was not the case. I
        think after the substitutions we made and Neto coming onto the pitch that ignited a little bit of fire and
        spark, he obviously scored in the end with a great cross from Giten. So I have to give that to him. It was a
        good pass, good cross, but I think that was also the first good thing he did in that game pretty much. So that
        tells you something too. So Neto finishes for 2-1 and we think we're in this. We can do this. We can equalize.
        We can get an equalizer. We can get a winner here. There's plenty of time. But Uncle Tossen had other plans,
        guys. Uncle Tozen. And look, I know that the spotlight is going to be on him. And that was a horrific mistake to
        make and I'm sure he's not going to hear the end of it. And I hope he doesn't hear the end of it. But Gusto's
        also to blame in that situation because why are you making that pass? You can absolutely see that leads have
        been impressing us whole game. They've been mounting pressure and you're making such a stupid pass back into
        Toen who's completely unaware, who's completely just doesn't know what's going on, thinks he's in training and
        then there's really nothing Sanchez can do to salvage that um horror show and we concede third and that's it.
        Game done, job done. Three points behind Aston Villa into fourth. With how tight it is in the in the table right
        now, another defeat could be detrimental to us. Seriously, it could mean, and I know it's early on in the
        season, and I'm not even talking about detrimental in terms of the title hopes, but I want a convincing campaign
        this season, guys. I want a convincing campaign of being in the top four, but pushing, you know, I wanted to
        push this season. So, we have to aim higher. We have to do better. And this is the consistency I've been talking
        about. I said Chelsea are our own enemies, and we are our own enemies. We make it so difficult. So, performance
        to forget. If you're a Le fan, congratulations. And I mean that wholeheartedly, not even sarcastically. Fair
        play to you. Um, Chelsea deserved nothing after that performance. And I hope that some serious conversations are
        going to be had because you cannot go from what we saw last week to this week. I know there was rotation, but
        the quality of the the drop off in quality cannot be that stark. And breathe. Anyways, guys, I hope you've
        enjoyed this video. Here's a nice smile from me because I mean that was a pretty negative review but you know
        what these things happen. Just go on a bit of a run in December now and prove why you are a good side. Okay.
