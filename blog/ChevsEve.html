        Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel. Welcome to Nina's Chelsea Corner if you're new around here. Chelsea
        beat Everton 2-nil at Stamford Bridge. It's a win at last, three points and a clean sheet to finally give us
        some happiness after what has been a very poor run of results. We were on course of going five games winless if
        we didn't win today. So, it was absolutely crucial that we got the job done to get a clean sheet, even better.
        So, we have to just say good, we got the job done. There were moments of imperfections. It wasn't all smooth
        sailing. At the very end of the second half, our clean sheet almost looked vulnerable as well. And I think on
        another day where Everton have a little bit more clinical finishing and luck on their sides, that's potentially
        not as straightforward of a game. But we're not going to go into tunnels and rabbit holes of if buts or may
        because the reality is we got the job done. It's a win and three points. So, it's very happy days. Um, I'm
        currently in Chicago, so I watched the game at 900 a.m., which was really strange. This is the earliest I've
        ever watched a live football match. So, I don't know how you guys do it. I mean, it's insane. Those of you who
        guys are out in the States and uh yeah, across other continents, it's um yeah, it's a it's a strange one, but
        here we are. It's morning. Currently filming this at 11 a.m. and got the whole rest of the day ahead. And at
        least that means less of a weekend's ruins as well, cuz I can imagine if we'd lost that game, it would have been
        pretty dark to go off the rest of the day and tomorrow and just know that it was a poor weekend. But yeah, um
        but it's so nice here. It's snowing currently. Well, it was snowing. It's currently kind of melting, but still a
        lot of snow. Proper winter. I was in New York for the last three days, which was also incredible. I'll share
        some photos and stuff with you, but yeah, enjoying my time out here. Um, but without further ado, let's get into
        this match review. Cole Palmer started this game. We were all itching and buzzing to see him return. And
        honestly, just having Cole Palmer back is such a boost of confidence and a boost of morale as well because, you
        know, how much he reciprocates from the fans, how much we're just so happy to see him. So, it was really, really
        great to see him uh play. And he of course got his goal, his first in September. Um, and honestly, if you told
        us over summer that this would be how Cole Palmer's season started, we'd all have been gutted for him because we
        know what he is capable of and how much he elevates the team. But to see him back in scoring, to see his
        celebration, Stamford Bridge needed that. So, it was absolutely brilliant to see. Um, four changes in total
        though. We obviously saw, as I said, Cole Palmer return. We saw Garnacho start, who I thought had a pretty
        subpar game, guys. Subpar's putting it kindly actually. I tweeted that he was auditioning for substitution
        pretty much from the moment he missed that first opportunity. But yeah, it was so disappointing. Garn actually
        did not get many things right today. Um, and we're not talking about half chances he missed. There was at least
        three opportunities there that were clear Clark clear and on any other day should be put away. So, he could have
        really extended our lead today. He could have secured us a better goal difference as we've really been uh yeah,
        struggling with that as well. um in our recent uh downturn in results. So, it was really disappointing to see
        that Gonacho just pretty much got every opportunity wrong today. Defending was poor. He was going in for late
        tackles and it was just like Gonacho like honestly mate, you are doing yourself a lot of wrong right now. So,
        yeah, it wasn't it wasn't great. Maresca should have brought him off earlier in my opinion. Um and the fact that
        he didn't um meant that we were just frustrated and we could potentially could have increased the chance
        creation and the opportunity to score more goals if Estabb and Kittens maybe came on earlier because Gonacha
        just was really doing nothing. But yeah, in terms of the first half though, not much really happened in terms of
        kind of that explosive start from the off. I thought it was quite difficult to get into the game once again. Um,
        we were misplacing so many opportunity, so many chance, so many passes in the first half. See, I'm not awake
        yet. I've had a coffee. It's too early to do analysis at this time. Um, but yeah, it was um pretty difficult to
        enter our rhythm as well. We were misplacing passes. Everyone just seemed to make a bad pass forward. We saw a
        lot from Enzo Fernandez in particular. Most famously that counteratt attack where he just yeah it was literally
        4v3 and he just passed it into an Ever Everton player and it really halted our momentum going forward. So we saw
        a lot of that and we just see seem to be not in it and that concentration that we keep talking about needs to
        improve because you cannot lose focus on any other day like I said with with Everton having a bit more luck up
        front. You saw Jack Greish uh miss a very clearcut opportunity. There were so many others. Um I can't even
        remember who off the top of my head now, but on any other day they score and that's a different game and we
        can't let them have that volume of opportunities that we do let opposition have. Um it just invites a lot of
        pressure. I thought we dealt with it pretty well on the most part today with a special big shout outs to uh the
        defensive line. I mean Wesley Farna put on a brilliant display. Trevor Chalaba with some key blocks. Malagus
        though who won himself man of the match with a goal as well to put us two nil up before Halime um a goal and
        assist today for him. A brilliant day. So what Morris is obviously doing with Malagusto is working. I just think
        it's the the whole team that need to step up to show a little bit more consistency in their roles so that we can
        get this chemistry going once again. But from what we saw uh at the back with Robert Sanchez as well, good
        communication uh with the defense today. There were moments again where we were almost uh at the brink of
        conceding, but we dealt well um where we could and we didn't just let our heads drop. So, it was nice to see
        that we've got this consistency going in the back line. So, Marca should really stick with Afana and Chalaba
        there with obviously Karee and how Ree James is being utilized. Ree James played his third consecutive full 90
        minutes. Um we didn't think these days would come, guys, but here they are. And I know Moresque has been quite
        uh apprehensive about handing him loads and loads of starts and playing him the full course, but he is able to
        do it. This is what Rhys James is here to do. He is our captain. We do need him and I think he brings on so much
        more. You see him as the mediator as well when things are kicking off on the pitch or players are losing their
        heads a little bit. We don't have leadership in terms of that, you know, old experience where you've got that
        veteran of a player to to help the younger ones, but Ru James is that player for us. So, we definitely need him
        in these games. So, it's great to see him get more minutes and to build his confidence and his minutes as well
        um in the next hopefully uh few more games as well. Um Enzo Fernandez looked a little bit tired again. We
        obviously saw him struggle and look sluggish against Atlanta midweek. So, we all thought maybe it's time for
        Santos to start. That wasn't the case, though. I thought it took him some time to get into the game as well. But
        then I did think he had some good crosses and passes in the second half as well. But again, sometimes you just
        need to be a little bit more quick. And it's still even when we were two up, we were too slow for my liking at
        times. You know, when you're looking at hitting Everton on the break, why slow down the ball? Why pass it back
        when you've got acres of space in midfield that you can use and push up further across? So, it was kind of
        annoying in that regards and I wish we kind of did a little bit more. But maybe that's just the um the high
        expectations and me talking cuz I know we're so much more capable of um attacking proess being quicker, being
        more rapid, and that's exactly what you get from our wingers. Um but yeah, Gonacho obviously came off. We saw
        Santos come on as well. Cole Palmer was also substituted for some rest time who I thought he did pretty well
        today. Joel Pedro as well substituted. Kittens came on, we saw him feature, Estal featured, but I think it was
        almost a little bit too late for Estal to settle into the game. I mean, for 10 minutes, how much can you really
        just kick? Well, you know, hit the ground running. And some of you might argue, but yeah, Nina, we've seen him
        do it when he has come on previously for short cameos. Yeah, but he also hasn't had much game time recently, so
        that's going to happen. He is still so young. He's going to need a little bit more consistency in a run of games
        in order to get into his groove. But yeah, he was getting doubled, even tripled up on and that's going to happen
        when you are as good as Estabout is at his current age and the threat he poses. Uh Gittens with some very
        dangerous crosses as well. I think if we're getting more players on the end of those, then you're looking at um
        another very creative outlet there. So again, right now, if I'm looking at who is more dangerous on that left
        wing, if Netto is out on the right, uh as to say, then for me it's Gitens at the moment. I'm not seeing enough
        from Garnacho to warrant him to continue playing. What he showed us in today's game with those several
        opportunities isn't good enough because when it comes to playing games where you might get just one of those to
        change a game and you're missing three or four and that ratio is so stark, it's not good enough and you're not
        going to be a reliable um outlet there on the wing. So G actually disappointed me today and if I have to
        accumulate all the chances I've seen him um yes he has scored a couple good goals but the conversion rate is is
        very very concerning if I might say. Let me know what your thoughts on Garnacho are but at the moment he's
        really not living up to what people envisioned he would do. I was with the fans who raised their eyebrows at the
        signing when we first got him. So, it didn't quite make sense to me and it still doesn't quite make sense to me.
        But yeah, let me know what you guys think about Gacho. Let me know what you thought about the performance. But
        yeah, I wouldn't say we blew Everton away today. I'd say that we got the job done and we kept the clean sheet,
        some good defending, good safes from Robert Sanders as well, who deserves a shout out. Good to see Cole Palmer
        back. So, plenty of positives to take, but you know, we're not in a good place at the moment in terms of
        consistency. This is what I keep saying about you can't win a game and then drop off the way you do and then go
        and draw and then it can't be all over the place if you want to be seriously pushing and making yourself
        comfortable at the top of that table. So, yeah, it has to be so so much better Chelsea, but it's a good place to
        start. It's our first win in December after the amazing November we had. December's been a very rough start. So
        hopefully we can now turn the tides a little bit. Obviously tough game still coming up, but again this is a bit
        of momentum. It's a clean sheet. It's time for the players to relax, take a breath, and learn from previous
        mistakes. For Moresca to assess everything he saw as well, but stop tinkering. Make tweaks, but don't make
        wholesale rotations. We don't need them. Okay, for can play. Reese James is fit to play. Cole Palmer is fit to
        play. Just keep the consistency going and make occasional tweaks where you need. Kaisedo is going to be
        obviously returning. This is his last match suspension. So, brilliant to see him get back into the side, but
        this is where we start building a little bit of consistency hopefully in terms of player setup. And that's
        really going to put us on course and becoming hopefully a more cohesive team that can perform game in game out
        as opposed to game in and then not game out, you know? So, yeah. But anyways, guys, I hope you've enjoyed this
