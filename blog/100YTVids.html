    <p>Last week, I watched a video on Youtube about starting a Youtube channel, and the eesiest method to get there was
        to
        record on 100 Youtube videos before you decide to pursue building the channel or not.
    </p>
    <p>The lady in the video explained how it is a challenge that will make you stick to your goal and you only get to
        judge yourself after you have recorded 100 videos. The idea behind this method,
    <ul>
        <li>is you get to learn the skill.</li>
        <li>the challenge makes you commit to the goal.</li>
        <li>it becomes impossible to give up after you have seen the outcome.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>She also made the suggestion that you don't have to shoot fancy videos with and have high end video editing
        skills, it could
        just be you and your camera, talking about stuff that interests you or that you care about. She said this is a
        way to make yourself
        commit to a goal which ends up with you having 100 Youtube videos as result.
        She also, talked about how the Youtubers we all admire have somewhat of over 100 Youtube videos, the have
        mastered
        making videos and that is why it seems so easy for them. On the other hand, you, cannot possibly know if you
        channel is going to grow and whether you would go viral even, you cannot control that, what you control is
        getting to 100
        Youtube videos posted.
    </p>
    <p>Why I think what she suggests makes sense, imagine you were building a mud house, sand castle or a paper jet as a
        child.
        when you are done with the endeavour, do you remember how proud you felt? How eager you were to show it to your
        friends and family and how personal that thing you built felt to you? This is exactly like that I think,
        because, after
        you have recorded 100 Youtube videos there's no way you would quit and even if you did, kudos, because now you
        have learnt a valueable lesson, which is you set a challenge for yourself and you saw it through. That fact
        alone is something to be proud of. </p>
    <p>
        I have decided to record 100 Youtube videos in 2026. I will be uploading videos continually until I get to that
        number.
        This is important for me because I really love Youtube. I want to learn to shoot content about topics and things
        that interest me.
        And, what better way to do it? than to actually shoot videos and post them. It will be awkward or unsettling in
        at first, but I am sure
        I will get the hang of it, editing, speaking, facial expressions, accent you name them, I will learn them all as
        I embark on this journey.
    </p>
    <p> My Youtube channel will be like Primeagen's channel, like OrdinaryGamers, like Pewdewpie's channel and so much
        more of whatever I would like it to be. My viewers will get the chance to watch me grow and do things that
        interest me will gaining value. My content will be focused on Tech, Programming and fun (Games, social media
        trends and lots more). Only after recording a 100 Youtube videos will I know my style, what are my strenghts
        that I can
        refine, what are my weaknesses I can polish, correct or undo. I will learn what works for Youtube and what
        doesn't. Not before! I have always been fantasizing about starting my Youtube channel a long time ago, four
        years to be
        exact, but I have never really been committed. This time it is different. I will see this through and never look
        back. I have come up with a strategy to learn what to say and how to improve on my overall video skills,
        which is to copy at first, say the things other Youtubers I like say, move my body the way they move their
        bodies, speak the
        way they speak, and produce content the way they do until I master it and can do it on my own without copying.
        This is the blueprint I will
        follow to acheive this goal. </p>
    <p>My first Youtube videos is already up, now I know there's no stopping and I vae to keep going to get to a 100. In
        the video I introduced myself and the channel, what viewers should expect, and my goal of getting to a 100
        Youtube videos.
        It has 11 views as I am writing this, I shared the it's link to my status on Whatsapp and encouraged my contacts
        to support me by watching the video.
    </p>
    <p>Video 1 is up, video 2 & 3 will be posted this week. THERE CAN BE NO STOPPING NOW!</p>
