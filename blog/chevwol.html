    <p>Hi everyone, welcome back to the blog. Welcome to Yslcodes Chelsea corner if you're new around here. I just got
        back from Stamford Bridge after Chelsea beat Wolves 3-0. Moving momentarily into second place for now after
        results went our way. Arsenal drew to Sunderland and Tottenham drew to Man United. So it meant that we
        absolutely at every single cost had to get the three points today. And we did one better. We got a clean sheet.
        Those don't come as a given nowadays. So we'll absolutely take it. A lot will say yes. Well done. It's a a win
        against 20th place Wolves who have picked up just two points this season, but hello. We conceded three goals
        this Wolves side. So, yes, it's a it's a job well done.</p>

    <p>It was certainly a game of two halves. Um, as far as that saying goes, this literally describes exactly how it
        was. I was literally bored in the first half, guys. Stanford Bridge was so flat. I said it felt like a Monday
        morning more than it felt like a Saturday night. It was just horrendous in there. There was a guy behind me who
        said he should have brought a book because that's how boring it was. Very dull, very static. We were just really
        lacking, I guess, energy. And we just seem so disinterested to be there playing this game. It was the usual side
        to side football. We see a lot um in Morris style. We see a lot of this recycling the ball from our wingers into
        our fullbacks. No overlaps. It just gets recycled back into midfield and then over to the other flank. And it's
        the same thing. and Wolves know what we're doing. So, it really felt like we were getting nothing out that first
        half.</p>

    <p>And I didn't really have an issue with the lineup as such. I knew Moresca was going to again probably go for um
        Garnacho because he's been trying him out here and there. Estal's not getting starts at the minute. Pedroto
        seems to be the most highly favored winger and certainly the most hardworking in Moresca's eyes. So, that's why
        he gets to play up against his former club. Got a goal as well. Um, but we'll talk about the goals in a little
        moment.</p>

    <p>So, I think we definitely came out the blocks in the second half with a little bit more energy. I think Moresca
        being proactive with substitutions earlier was absolutely great. We obviously got the goal um from Garnacho
        assisting Malagusto who got his first goal for Chelsea, but also as I learned his first senior goal. Guys,
        that's incredible. And I mean, what a way to do it. I've got to be happy for him. But I do have to say before
        the goal, Malagusto was making a lot of mistakes. He wasn't great on the ball. There was a bit too much um
        anxiety when he was on the ball and I think that it didn't really help. Um he didn't look confident in my eyes,
        but he got the goal and again we have to give him credit. Credit where it's due. Um he gets on the top of a
        Garnacho assist and that was the uh first assist of Gonacho. He got another one later. I thought Gonacho was
        quite proactive in many aspects. He was trying to get uh in the right spaces. He was trying to take on his man
        and unleash a few good uh crosses and obviously two were pinpoint cuz they were assist. He wasn't getting greedy
        trying to get shots off, but he certainly looked like the winger that was doing a little bit more in terms of
        trying to reach output. So a lot of frustration was express expressed um for Pedronto in the first half as well
        because again that recycling I kept talking about just the same thing repeatedly was there and and and not much
        else. So it was quite frustrating to see that. Sorry guys, I haven't drank water all day. I've just forgotten.
        So yeah, I'm ill as well. Anyways, like it never happens.</p>

    <p>Um, so yeah, Pedro, he was a bit frustrating to watch, but he did get his goal later on and it was a a brilliant
        one, brilliant one as such. But to go chronologically, which I don't ever really do, is Esbal comes on and guys,
        let me just set the scene for you. Like Stamford Bridge is quiet. So quiet. Eerily quiet. I wish we could do
        better um to to lift the atmosphere. It really isn't great. I had two um people who had never been to a Chelsea
        game before sat with me and I felt a little bit embarrassed that it was that quiet and this is their first
        impression being lifelong Chelsea fans of Stamford Bridge because it was that quiet and it just needs to be so
        much better. That is criticism that we we do take. And when um you have rival fans coming to Stanford Bridge and
        saying, "Is this a library or your support is crap?" and you're sitting there going, "Yeah, it it really is. It
        needs to be so much better."</p>

    <p>But anyways, guys, I've gone down another rabbit hole, but I wanted to set the scene for you. Standard Bridge is
        choir. Estabal is warming up on the sideline and Enzo Moresca calls him over and it's what, minute 60 something.
        It's not even like 80th minute as he did against Tottenham or as he's done with his um late substitutions in
        Premier League games. And honestly, when I tell you every single person in that stadium, obviously Chelsea fans
        were just given life. It's like spark. It's such an incredible reception that he gets every single time he's
        substituted on. Guys, I absolutely haven't seen anything like it. It's the same, if not better, than what Cole
        Palmer gets when he's playing for us because we just know how much magic he's going to bring onto the pitch when
        he's there. And he never fails to amaze us. I think every single time we think we've seen the very best out of
        him, he comes out with something new and it's just like igniting all the fire in all the Chelsea fans and
        they're so so eager and the atmosphere shifts. All it takes guys is an 18year-old Brazilian wonder kid to come
        onto the pitch and the atmosphere just changes like that. So really really incredible to be honest.</p>

    <p>Um, honestly, I I describe Estal every single video I make, every single match review, and I just always want to
        find new words to describe how just incredible he is, and he's going to get so much better as well. Still so
        young, still such a high ceiling, and he's not even starting games yet. So, to think he's had this much impact
        and touched the fan base just by simply appearing as a substitute with the cameos here and there, it just goes
        to show how how special this player is. So, yeah. Estal comes on and he's instantly instant impact. He squares a
        lovely ball into Pedro Netto who oh sorry Ja Pedro who puts it away. It's a great finish from him and you can
        see that Pedro is pointing at Esau giving him all the credit for that. Um but it's just also what Pedro needed
        just that bit of confidence that he's been missing. He had a shot I think it was in the first half and it just
        drifted wide and it was a bit frustrating to see because you think that opportunity would have scored any day of
        the week in the club world cup tournament as he was doing. So really nice there to to see them have that lingard
        play and form this chemistry and it just again makes you so hopeful when Cole Palmer returns how special this
        dynamic there can really be. So really really brilliant with two nil up. feels great.</p>

    <p>And then the third goal comes again. Gonacho pinpoint cross to Netto who's on the end of it. And um he finishes
        perfectly. They go over, they sit together, their celebration, the traditional Garnacho celebration, which he's
        now obviously doing at Chelsea. But yeah, I have to say I'm critical of Gacho. I have my reservations and
        skepticism about him because I still think there's a lot to his game that can improve and he can certainly
        become more consistent hopefully. But I have to say it was a great performance from him. So yeah, front line I
        thought in terms of um output from the players we got is great.</p>

    <p>But then I wanted more. I wanted more from Liam Dilap. I wanted more from Ja Pedro as I guess a duo because
        obviously Ja Pedro was playing in behind. Um and then when Marissa made substitutions the dynamic just kept
        changing with who was going where and it became a little bit more open. Everyone had a bit more of a free role.
        Um, but I think the way we played, especially in the first half, because it's so out wide all the time and
        recycled into midfield, we simply shut out our central threat there in Liam Dap and Jo Pedro. There's just
        nothing much they can really do. For my liking, Joel Pedro was way too deep at times and it meant that he was
        completely cut off from Liam Dap. And then also when Liam Dap was kind of picking up the ball from way ahead of
        edge of the area, there's not that player ahead of him that he can uh pass into. So, we need to work out how we
        can utilize them in a better way because like God knows what's going to happen when Liam Dilap gets service and
        he's able to come out in these like positions where he can be one-on-one. You know, he's going to put the ball
        away more time than not. We saw him do he we saw him do it Ipsswitch last year. So, I think it's going to be
        really interesting to see how that um dynamic plays out.</p>

    <p>Midfield, superb. Enzo Fernandez today, guys, our man of the match. Um, unfortunately he came off with a little
        bit of an injury, but I think it's something that has been building with his knee and he's not set to travel to
        Argentina for international break. Um, so I guess that's a good thing from the justification that he can recover
        and he can have have a little bit of time to hopefully get better. But Enzo Fernandez is a player that's
        literally been running to ground these last couple years with how much game time he's had, with how much travel
        he has to to make to his international duties and um playing through the whole club world cup tournament into
        the friendlies into the season and it's just been non-stop for him. So um to see him put on a performance like
        today, it was just truly so special. We're always on about Kaisedo. We know what type of beast he is, but Enzo
        Fernandez has often been in and out and inconsistent. So I think for him to to get the man of the match award is
        uh is very deserving today. And some of the balls that he was making uh through and in behind defense was really
        really positive to see. His ball recovery, his kind of relentless running, it was really impressive to see. So
        very very happy for him.</p>

    <p>And overall defensewise kept the clean sheet. So as much as I've criticized our defense this season, I'm going to
        say today fair enough. But I will also say Wolves didn't do that much to really trouble us. So the defense test
        is still very much a question mark. Moving into the fixtures we have after the international break, that's when
        we'll really see um just how great we can be. But for me, Mesa needs to stick with this setup for now because
        I'm quite happy to see Kakaro, Reese James, and Fana and Chalaba uh for the time being. And I think we need to
        just try it out and push it a little bit further. They got the clean sheet against Tottenham. They've got the
        clean sheet today. Build on that. Make it something that we can hopefully lean on for a little bit of stability
        and then make your changes just however you need to later on. Josh Achin Kong has been incredible. He probably
        warrant starts as well, but just test something for now. See how it works and hopefully we can get some
        consistency out of this.</p>

    <p>So yeah, there was a lot of uh Chelsea fans who were absolutely ecstatic at full time. We were filming the fan
        cams on Chelsea Fan TV and I didn't even see us that lively after we beat Liverpool at Stamford Bridge. Um
        whether it's because we're second, whether because fans now believe that Chelsea could have possibly a way into
        a supposed title race being six points behind Arsenal. Um is is quite funny. We obviously have a game against
        them uh in a few weeks time. I think for me the biggest thing I'm still questioning is Chelsea's consistency.
        We're too inconsistent. That's the problem. I guess it's a great time to be inconsistent in the Premier League
        because all the other teams around us seem to be in the same spiral of results at the minute. However, I think
        we need to just look at ourselves and really build some momentum. We've got a tough game uh to return to after
        international break being Burnley at 12 away from home on Saturday. So fingers crossed that one goes okay cuz
        then after that we've got Barcelona and Arsenal both at Stamford Bridge. Both incredible games that we're going
        to highly look forward to. Hopefully, we have a few more players back. Cole Palmer is still a big question mark.
        I'm not going to raise my hopes, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
