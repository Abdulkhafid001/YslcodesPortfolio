        Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel. Welcome to Nina's Chelsea corner if you're new around here. Chelsea
        beat Burnley two nil away at turf more. Collect the three points, a clean sheet, and we head into a very big
        week, probably the biggest week of our season, uh with some momentum, a little bit of self-esteem, a 12:30
        kickoff against Burnley away from home after international break never is easy. However, we did a good job of
        it. I don't think it was a brilliant performance or we blew them away. Um, I think we were quite slow generally
        in settling into the game, but then we did pick up after the first goal. So, overall, I have not much
        complaints. I think it was exactly what we needed to do. And we just have to be pretty happy. Not really too
        much into it. I think my biggest takeaway today is that Moresca managed minutes really well. We obviously saw
        Ree James come off uh at Halime, which you never want your captain coming off, especially when you've got a slim
        one. on the lead away from home. However, we absolutely all understood why that was the case and it was very
        clever from Mesa to do that. Kedo also got a rest today. Um, you know, we've got players like Gacho who didn't
        make it on today, Estaval. So, these are all players that are going to be utilized and ready for a big big week.
        So, really happy. Let me know how you guys feel in the comments down below. Um, to those of you who are new to
        the channel, welcome. Please hit the subscribe button if you enjoy the content and don't forget to hit the
        thumbs up as well. really helps the channel out and um always appreciative of your support. For those of you who
        watched my clips on Sky, um there was a very interesting reception to some of the things I said and for those of
        you who want to see it, it is up on my channel. Um but it was a quote uh taken from one of my um clips about me
        being more scared of Burnley than Barcelona and Arsenal, which is obviously a really funny thing to say. I think
        if you're a Chelsea fan, you probably understand where that's coming from. And you know, generally we struggle
        to play these teams that, no offense and no disrespect, lower down in the table, relegation bound teams that
        pretty much often sit back at you and we're so so um challenged by breaking them down. But that wasn't the case
        today. Burnley did not sit back. It was actually quite an open game and it meant we had a little bit more space
        to work with and we created a lot more. We were just slightly off in terms of finishing today and yes, we scored
        two goals, but there were opportunities for more, but we just couldn't really find the net and something was
        always slightly missing. So, yeah, that was the justification behind that. Luckily, Burnley are just all brushed
        up now and we've beaten them. So, hopefully we can get into uh next week's game and play our football. Uh it's a
        massive game both at Stamford Bridge, obviously Barcelona in the Champions League, followed by Arsenal at the
        weekend. We are currently sat second in this moment of time I'm filming this video. And it's not a bad place to
        be, guys. Not a bad place to be. Before Arsenal play tomorrow, we are three points behind them. So, all in all,
        it's a pretty good place to be, especially with uh how much I guess not really inconsistency. I think with
        inconsistency I mean that we have had some great results but they've also been in isolation of each other and
        what I mean by that is we haven't really been able to use momentum of such big wins and go on a bit of a run and
        I'd love for us to just go on a on a winning streak and that's going to be hard with games coming up but you
        know with injuries slightly returning and easing and getting better hopefully that could be something that we
        are going to get better at doing getting better at building chemistry with each other. Cole Palmer's obviously
        out and we all know it's a little bit laughable. Um the whole toe story, but it just seems like for now we're
        going to have to make do without Cole Palmer, which is a shame because he is so missed and we are just so so
        missing his creativity and the spark and everything he brings to the team and how he elevates everyone around
        him. And I honestly believe if Cole Palmer was here right now, Jah Pedro and Liam Dilap would look like better
        players. they'd be making better decisions or perhaps doing a little bit more. Um, and he just ties everyone in
        so so well. Um, but back to the game, obviously, Moresca rotated once again. We've seen that this is now a
        pattern. He's obviously managing minutes in competitions, managing injuries. We have a lot of players who are
        differently suited to different teams, have different strengths. So, it really does all vary. So, I guess we
        have some sort of intrigue always about how he sets us up. And I think today was pretty decent. that defensive
        line managed to get Glei. Uh there was a couple funny moments um and obviously Sanchez decided to boot the ball
        into I can't remember which player it was. Um and it kind of came back um to put us in a little bit of pressure,
        but other than that, good collecting crosses. Uh distribution was all right. So nothing like major there. I
        thought Andre Santos uh being, you know, the player he was today, playing the full 90 minutes, that's an
        opportunity he knows he's not going to get very often. And he took it perfectly. He was so good. Ball recovery
        great. He was trying to get forward. He had a couple really good interceptions and clean tackles. So, really
        nice to see him having a good time out there. And um deservedly man of the match. Uh I would have selected him
        for player of the match as well. I thought he was a really really uh big standout today. Enzo Fernandez I
        thought was also good and it's nice to see them play a little bit more with each other. I mean I always say
        Kaisedo's been run to the ground. He's been offered to international duty. We're literally banking on him being
        his best self next week because he's going to be so instrumental to everything we do against Barca and Arsenal.
        So a really key player there and I'm happy he got his rest and I'm happy that Santos used his opportunity and
        really shenan today. So, let me know what you guys thought of his performance. Do you potentially want to see
        maybe more of him? Um, or how do we utilize Santos more? Because that's definitely a player we know has a lot of
        special qualities and we've all been so excited to see him in a Chelsea shirt with the amount of back and forth
        and everything around um his whole uh you know transitioning um from teams and is he going out on loan, is he
        going to be a Chelsea player, what is happening? Um so to know we have him here to stay is really really
        positive. So yeah, that's a a real great thing to see. Um I thought our attack was a little bit lackluster at
        times. I think both goals were really beautiful in the sense that obviously for the first one uh Marka did a lot
        of hard work there holding up the ball laid it off into Gitens who had a really beautiful pinpoint cross uh to
        find a diving netto uh who heads it in for a one- nil lead. And it was really really nice to see that dynamic. I
        thought Gitens I've always spoke about the fact he's got a great first touch on him. I think he obviously has
        shown he can shoot and he can uh cross. I think maybe it's more about putting the ball at the back of the net
        more and I think hopefully we'll see that. But very very nice. He's obviously not going to be utilized or
        involved uh in the Champions League or perhaps he will but maybe not from the start because again he played the
        the majority and he uh is probably going to make way for some of our other players. Um, so I thought really nice
        first goal. We're in the lead, but we know it's a 1-nil lead. It's quite slim. You're away from home and
        particularly before the goal, we weren't very good. Burnley had a lot of kind of foray forward into our half.
        Um, we had some very clean tackles again involved. So, praise needs to be given to defense there because we
        dealt well with those moments where they came, but it certainly was a slow start from us and it just felt a
        little bit like, come on, Chelse, we're back now. Premier League football's back. you're not in international
        break anymore. Lien up and get this business sorted. So yeah, the goal definitely helped. It lifted us a little
        bit. Morale changed and you could see there was an obvious shift in uh the way we were playing. So really happy
        to see that Ree James comes off as mentioned earlier. Moresca is managing him, resting him. It's good to see as
        well. I thought it was quite a physical game. There were a lot of fouls here and there and I thought you want to
        protect your players. There are certainly other players that you know could at least defend out this lead or not
        even defend it, go for another, score some more. I thought we could have scored a lot more, but um I just think
        in attack it was a little bit slow. You know, you see Liam Dap and Shah Pedro, they just don't seem to really
        have a chemistry forming. And while Liam Dilap was doing the right things in terms of the runs, uh, sort of, you
        know, making himself available in pockets, it wasn't quite um, it wasn't quite what we want to see in terms of
        the end product and what he has to offer as our out and out number nine. So, we really do need to see more. And
        I believe I've seen something like Liam Dap started seven games and he's got no assists, no goals, and he's got
        one red card, which isn't a nice stat. I know. And I believe there's so much more to see from Liam Dilap. And I
        think I'm really intrigued to see how Moresi utilizes him next week. So I think Liam Dap's going to be a very
        important player. You want to be playing with a striker like that. Someone who's very physical and can make the
        runs, can be a little bit of a menace. And you know when he's one-on-one uh in a goal scoring opportunity more
        times than not, he puts the ball away. We just need to see it. So hopefully that comes with time. Jo Pedro in
        many aspects reminded me of Nicholas Jackson for us because again doing some of the right things, driving the
        ball forward, uh creating something and again just being um doing the right things, but then just almost that
        final moment he either dribbles into a defender or the shot is not quite it and you're thinking you can also do
        better. Like we know that this whole thing about potential and expectation is high because we know what these
        players are capable of. We saw Joa Pedro at his very best over the club World Cup tournament and we know that
        that player is there. I guess a big part of it was Cole Palmer as well being there linking up with him but Pedro
        is a bright player and I think again it just needs to click a little bit more and he's been scoring you know a
        couple goals but I think we just have higher expectations for him. So overall across the front line I thought
        wingers did a better job than as mentioned Pedro and Liam Dap today. So hopefully that can improve but good to
        see that you know you got players like Gittens and Netto who are now contributing to the um GNA because again we
        spoke about low output from our wingers and we wanting to see more and again that there just needs to be a
        little bit more coming from them. So, I think it was nice to see. Um, and hopefully next week we can have a bit
        of a shift around. And this is the thing. I mean, my dad said if any Barcelona scouts are watching or they're
        analyzing our game right now, they're not going to know what to expect. How are we setting up? I couldn't tell
        you. You probably couldn't tell me. Mesa probably couldn't tell us cuz he doesn't know yet either. Uh, but this
        is the thing about us. We can really switch things. We can change things. we are quite unpredictable and that
        could be uh that could have negative connotations but also positive connotations because we've seen it play out
        in both ways. So I guess that's the good thing but nevertheless we're so excited for what is coming. I mean
        really really brilliant and then of course the second goal comes late on just before the 90minute mark and um
        it's lovely to see Mark U getting a a contribution there because I think he did all the hard work to hold up the
        ball there. He was very physical, very strong, and he laid it off beautifully. So, I think, yeah, it's really,
        really nice to see. It's just a breath of fresh air to get wins like this. Um, when you think sometimes there is
        cause for concern and I totally didn't mean that like Burnley are literally a bigger or a better team than
        Arsenal, Barcelona, of course, but we struggle in in games that are more hostile, that ky that we can't break
        down. But that wasn't the case with Burnley today. they really came out and played football. So, um I guess
        yeah, I want to give them some credit too because they have struggles, but there were some moments in that game
        where they could have also easily scored against us. So, um yeah, pretty happy with the result. We moving ahead
        to a really big week, guys. How excited are you? Um it doesn't get much better than that. Two games at Stamford
        Bridge, Champions League action against Barcelona, followed by Arsenal current league leaders and a team we
        haven't beaten in a very long time. So, it's time to put all of that aside and hope that we can get something
        out of it. I mean, again, I feel positive and confident because I've seen what we can do against the very best
        teams in Europe and what we did to PSG in that final will forever obviously be ingrained in our mind. So, we
        know we're capable of that. It's just about uh producing that on the pitch and performance will matter. It
        definitely won't be the case like today where you can play the way you did in many aspects and not get punished
        because you absolutely will. So yeah, guys, I'll have a preview out for that uh later on. And of course, I mean,
        I say later on, obviously not today, but when we get some team news and some uh press conference news from
        Enzoresca, I'll get a preview uploaded for you cuz that's going to be really, really exciting. Thank you so much
        for watching. Thank you again all for your support, the messages you send me, the comments, just everything. I
        love uh reading that and it honestly means more than you guys know. So, thank you so much for your support. I
        will see you very, very soon.
