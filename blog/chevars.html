        Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel.
        Welcome to Nina's Chelsea corner if you're new around here.
        I just got back from Stamford Bridge after Chelsea drew one all to Arsenal. An incredibly good derby to watch
        and one we were all so hyped up for and actually now in hindsight walking away from that game. I am disappointed
        that Chelsea didn't win. It was an absolutely excellent performance from everyone collectively. We went down to
        10 men in minute 38 when Kaisedo got sent off. our best player, our most valuable and important player on the
        pitch got sent off and we still put Arsenal to shame and we could have won the game. That just sums it up for
        you when you're walking away disappointed against the league leaders currently who look like the best team in
        Europe apparently and are putting so many good performances up to absolutely outplay them in every department in
        my opinion today is definitely a huge huge stepping stone for Chelsea. It's just a testament to what we've been
        building really and I think in terms of going toe-to-toe with the best teams out there. We've shown we can do it
        consistently. I think it's a very positive performance and it's a bit of a disappointing result because we
        definitely could have walked away with all three today and put ourselves well in reach further up there. But
        it's okay because there's plenty to be happy about. Trevor Chalabar scores first from a corner, might I add. Um
        it's almost like there you go Arsenal, here is a taste of your own medicine. And um I mean Matthew Harding
        erupted the whole stadium today. There was such a good atmosphere. Everyone was so up for it. You could feel
        that every single player was just reciprocating what the fans were showing. And I think in terms of passion,
        effort, uh hunger, all of those qualities were out there on the pitch today. And it's just so incredible to see
        that Chelsea had the belief coming out the blocks that we could absolutely have a gain there today. There was
        lots of Arsenal fans who were basically, you know, giving it large, saying that we're going to get absolutely
        destroyed and it's going to be a two-3 goal margin and all of that stuff. But I think Chelsea quietly believed
        that we are definitely capable of getting a result and playing very well. My famous quote that Burnley scares me
        more than Barcelona and Arsenal has actually turned out to be true because I'd argue Burnley in many cases were
        a lot more difficult to break down. The performance was very meh walking away from it. It was enough though. We
        got the clean sheet and the result and then we absolutely tore apart Barcelona midweek, put on an absolutely
        incredible show. Uh could have scored six that same night and then went on to draw at the weekend. could have
        won, but we were a man down. And when you're playing a very physical side like Arsenal who also made changes,
        brought on players uh who have uh a lot of creativity and output. It wasn't there today, but you know, when they
        do that to you, you're thinking maybe this isn't going to go our way. But I think I would love to praise and
        give Moresca his flowers today because for me Enzo Moresca has to take so much pride from that setup, the
        tactics and I always say he's always got something up his sleeve and he showed that again today. He set us up
        brilliantly and what was even better was he did not react negatively to the red cards. Yes, it was early on. It
        was in the first half. He could have brought on three defenders and taken off our whole attack and just played
        there for the draw, but he didn't do that. He was actually very very uh what's the word? Sensible in the way he
        managed the game. And I think it was actually uh pretty clear to see that even 11 v1 and then 10 v1 after the
        quality in terms of attacking and just still going up there and trying to ask questions rather than sit back and
        park up and just hope that we don't concede um wasn't the case. And we out there, we went out there and we
        played football because again that performance we saw in the first half before the red card gave us a lot of
        reason to believe that we could absolutely continue playing our football the way we were and I'm very happy that
        Moresca didn't make any rash decisions. Um I think it was clear to all of us that Estal would be the first
        player to come off though eventually when he made the first substitution. I didn't mind that though. He brought
        on Garnacho who was again taking it upon himself to try and create something get further up there. he was
        drifting in centrally as well um with his dribble. So he was definitely a problem too and it was just nice to
        see that um we kept on going. We we had the belief and I think in many many ways uh we were so much better than
        Arsenal today and I think that's a real big positive. Of course there the excuses are coming out and you know oh
        we had a a day less to rest or we've had a very overloaded schedule. Please don't talk to us about an overloaded
        schedule. We went and won a Club World Cup over summer, had no rest, then we went straight into our season off
        the back of the last, had so many players to manage through little niggles and injuries here and there, and we
        still managed. So, please, let's not talk about an overloaded schedule. You brought on four players uh against
        our two, whereas we when we were the ones who were a man down. So again, that just really goes to show how
        Arteta was struggling to respond and find a solution to what was going on on the pitch. And maybe on another
        day, one of the chances that Arsenal created was the end goin. However, I put that down to our good defending.
        We were tidy. Sanchez was on it today. I think thought his cross collection was brilliant and that's becoming a
        pattern. So he's been very dominant aerally and he was shutting down quite a big threat and Arsenal we know are
        quite dangerous on set pieces. So he was shutting all of that down, keeping everyone at bay. So really, really
        just pleased to see that. And um so where I was going with that point is nobody should take anything from
        Chelsea today. Of course Arsenal say this is their worst performance of the season, blah blah blah, but that's
        credit to Chelsea. We made them look poor today. And um how of of course you're going to be disappointed when
        you walk away with a draw after being a man up for pretty much an hour. Um, and again, you're probably feeling
        quite lucky to walk away with the draw. So, I'm pleased with the performance. I'm kind of disappointed with the
        result because I think we should have gotten out there and gotten more, but maybe that's just the a really
        excited Chelsea fan and me speaking after I saw some of those chances, some of those attacks that we put
        together. Um, but such a breath of fresh air to see that in a derby. And guys, let's talk about some man of the
        match performances because Ree James, I think you have I mean, I don't even know where to start with Ree James,
        guys. Deploy him in midfield, he's incredible. Deploy him at right back, he's incredible. You could pretty much
        put him up front at this point, he's going to be incredible. Reys James is an absolute superstar. Absolute
        superstar. If you look at him and everything he did today, absolutely everywhere across the pitch, there for
        interceptions, key tackles, uh driving the ball forward, uh a key assist to the goal from the corner. He was
        absolutely phenomenal today. And to say that about our club captain who we have seen at his very best, we've
        seen him lift the Champions League. We've seen him be involved in some of our best games and put on some
        absolutely brilliant performances, score some of the best goals we've seen. And there he is. He's continuing to
        surprise us and come out with even more and even better things. So to have a fully fit Reese James who's
        dropping performances like that is just insane to me guys. And you know the next sort of point I want to raise
        is that I think when you look at Chelsea and everyone's talking about what this Chelsea side could achieve this
        season, what is this Chelsea side trying to do? Um what is the ambition here for Chelsea? I think it's clear to
        see that for me personally as a Chelsea fan, as a match going fan, I don't even think Chelsea are at our best,
        right? We're not at our best right now. Do you know how crazy that sounds? And what I mean by that is we've
        still got Cole Palmer to return who's going to elevate us levels. And he's not only going to elevate our team in
        terms of the output he's going to provide with goals and assists, he's going to elevate Joel Pedro. He's going
        to elevate Estal. He's going to elevate Pedro Netto, Garnacho, whoever other winger he combines with because he
        is that player and he's going to do so much more. So, you're talking about a whole another upgrades on Chelsea
        when Cole Palmer's back and fit and at his best. Then you're looking at Levi Cole Will who's out. He is our best
        center back. He is our best center back. When he was out um you know over the summer, we we were worried and we
        saw what that could do and we saw that it did present us with challenges. We've been scrambling for center back
        pairings left, right, and center. And we finally maybe have the duo in Farana and Chalabar. But you know, when
        Levi Colewall comes back eventually, again, you're talking about another better Chelsea. Romeo Lavia, again, a
        prospect that sounds better on paper than in reality because he's always injured. But there is still still so
        much more to Chelsea's game that we can offer through throughout the course of the season. Whereas with Arsenal
        today, yeah, they had Gabrielle and Cibba out, but we have still seen that team with Gabrielle and Celiba this
        season and them be at their optimum level. Yeah, they might argue, you know, oh, Dard wasn't there and your
        careers has been out and Kai Havitz blah blah blah, whatever, but the optimum team in terms of what they can do
        and produce is there to see, but with Chelsea, we know that there is still more we can do. And that excites me.
        That excites me and it should excite everyone because I think um what Maresca is showing is that he is able to
        now sort of integrate players. He's able to find everyone's strongest position and use everyone to their
        strengths. Um oh and of course can I add Estal when he's starting backto-back games when he's starting game in
        game out and he's slowly building himself up and actually I think Moresca now is using him very very wisely. So,
        the bigger picture is quite exciting and I think that's probably what I want to leave this match review on and I
        think everybody should be so proud of themselves. I think it was a a brilliant game to experience in person as
        well. The atmosphere, the drive, guys. I'm pretty sure this was me throughout like the whole second half because
        I was like Chelsea do not deserve to lose this game and it would have been incredibly heartbreaking to do that.
        And I'm just I really really wanted that win. I was praying for it, guys. But there you go. That's football for
        you sometimes. But take the wins that we saw there um in Villa Jun so great for um self-esteem as well. And I
        mean uh you look at players like Jo Pedro that chance he missed in the first half guys. I said to the people
        around me, I was like if Liam Dap was in that position, he would have taken a hit on that straight away. But I
        don't know why Jo Pedro just overthought it a little bit and didn't go for it. But that could have been our
        1-0il lead. Uh and potentially that is a different game there as well. However, enough with the whatifs. I'm
        very very pleased with the team. So so incredible. Let me know your thoughts. What did you guys think? Um but
        yeah, incredibly proud of this Chelsea side. I think we showed such great maturity, such great drive. It's so
        easy when you get a red card, especially playing against a a tough side to just lower your head and sort of give
        up, but we didn't do that. We didn't do that. And that is a great great indication of how far we're coming and
        how much better we're coping with circumstances, bad days, good days. So, I'm really really happy, guys. Um on
        to leads next. We're back at um where we were with Burnley. Like I said, the tougher game coming up. Um but
        we'll see how we get on. Of course, Kaisedo out is going to be a bit tough, but we have Santos now who is going
        to be um waiting on this opportunity. And he took it well when Kaisedo was out last time, so he's going to be
        waiting for this. But let me know what you guys think. Subscribe to my YouTube channel. Please hit the like
