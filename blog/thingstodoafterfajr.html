    <h1 class="title">9 Things to Do After Fajr for Immense Blessings.</h1>

    <div class="intro">
        <p>Assalamu Alaikum. Welcome to the daily reminder. If you establish these nine things as a routine after Fajr,
            Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala will give you so many blessings. Watch how your life changes when you practice
            these points. All of them are easy, short, and powerful. The last two, especially, hold many secrets.</p>
    </div>

    <p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned that Allah gives lots of <em>barakah</em> (blessings) to this Ummah in
        the early time of the morning. Even people in the West realize the power and secrets of waking up early to
        achieve success. Let us count them together.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Don't Sleep After Fajr</h3>
            <p>The first challenge is to not sleep after Fajr. While it is not <em>haram</em> (forbidden) to sleep after
                Fajr, if you want to achieve greatness and blessings, you should stay awake. The Sunnah of the Prophet
                (peace be upon him) was not to sleep after this prayer.</p>
            <p>The Prophet (peace be upon him) passed by his daughter Fatima when she was sleeping after Fajr and said,
                "Wake up and witness the <em>Rizq</em> (provision) of Allah." This is the time when provisions are
                distributed. You will find activeness in your mind and focus. It is the best time to study, memorize
                Quran, and work. To achieve this, try to sleep early at night so you do not wake up lazy.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Praise Allah Upon Waking</h3>
            <p>As soon as you wake up, praise Allah. He gave you life and another opportunity. Recite:
                <em>"Alhamdulillahillazi ahyana ba'da ma amatana wa ilayhin-nushur"</em> (All praise is due to Allah who
                gave us life after He has taken it away from us, and unto Him is the return).
            </p>
            <p>Recall the blessings: the roof over your head, food, drink, family, health, and Islam. A narration says
                that if you recite these praises in the morning and evening, it is as if you have thanked Allah for all
                His creation. Remember the heavenly law: <strong>"If you are thankful, I shall increase you"</strong>
                (Quran).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Glorify Allah (Tasbeeh)</h3>
            <p>Say <em>SubhanAllah</em> (Glory be to Allah). Allah encouraged this before sunrise and before sunset. The
                Prophet (peace be upon him) advised us to make abundant <em>Tasbeeh</em> in the morning because it is
                the prayer of every creation, and through it, Allah gives <em>Rizq</em>.</p>
            <p>The birds and mountains glorify Allah. You can say <em>SubhanAllah, Alhamdulillah, La ilaha illa Allah,
                    Allahu Akbar</em>. This will fix your mood and strengthen you, just as Allah told the Prophet (peace
                be upon him) to glorify Him when his chest felt tight.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Recite the Quran</h3>
            <p>Recite the Quran every day, especially in the beginning of the day. The Prophet (peace be upon him)
                indicated that a house becomes vast and filled with blessings when the Quran is recited therein. Start
                your day with the <em>barakah</em> of the Quran, even if it is just a few verses (2, 5, or 10 verses).
                You will notice the blessings in your day immediately.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Send Salawat upon the Prophet (SAW)</h3>
            <p>Send peace and salutations upon Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). The Prophet said if you send peace
                upon him once, Allah sends peace and blessings upon you ten times. If you do it three times, you get
                thirty blessings.</p>
            <p>Try to do this at least 10 times in the morning. You need the mercy and <em>Salah</em> of Allah to
                descend upon you to start your day right.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Istighfar (Seeking Forgiveness)</h3>
            <p>Keep <em>Astaghfirullah</em> on your tongue. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said that if you make
                abundant <em>Istighfar</em>, Allah will suffice you from anything that worries you. Allah will make a
                way out of every difficulty and sustain you from where you do not expect.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Perform Salat al-Duha</h3>
            <p>You can perform this prayer anytime after sunrise until just before Dhuhr. It is an act of gratitude for
                every joint in your body (equivalent to 360 charities). It protects you throughout the day. Do at least
                two <em>rak'ahs</em>; it takes only 5 to 10 minutes but brings massive change to your life.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Tawakkul (Reliance on Allah) & Dua</h3>
            <p>Practice reliance on Allah right from the start of the day. A sign of <em>Tawakkul</em> is making Dua.
                Talk to Allah in your own language. Ask Him for help with your paperwork, your exams, your business, or
                your marriage.</p>
            <p>When you leave your house, say: <em>"Bismillahi tawakkaltu 'alallah, la hawla wa la quwwata illa
                    billah."</em> If you truly rely upon Allah, He will sustain you just as He sustains the birds that
                leave in the morning with empty stomachs and return full.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h3 class="activity">Spend in Charity (Sadaqah)</h3>
            <p>Spend, especially in the beginning of the day. This can be a set charity, or even spending on your
                family. Buying food for your children or groceries for your wife counts as charity. Do not be stingy
                with yourself or your family.</p>
            <p>You can also feed animals, like cats or birds. The intention is to start the day by giving. Allah says,
                "My servant, you spend, and I will spend on you." Ask yourself: How am I going to make the world a
                better place today?</p>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>May Allah Subhanahu wa Ta'ala bless you all, grant you what you wish for, ease your difficulties, cure the
        sick, and provide sustenance to those in need. Ameen.</p>
