    <p>
        Hi everyone, welcome back to my channel. Welcome to Nina's Chelsea corner if you're new around here and welcome
        to my match preview of Chelsea Barcelona in the Champions League at Stamford Bridge. One of the most iconic ties
        in our history certainly and one we are so excited for. It doesn't get any bigger than that to be honest and
        after our absence in the Champions League to return and get to play against the likes of Bayern Munich,
        Barcelona and hopefully get a result is absolutely incredible. It just shows how far Chelsea has come after so
        many difficulties. We are back against the very best. So, an absolutely blockbuster game at Stamford Bridge. So
        excited, guys, and I'm sure you are all too. So, let me know how you're feeling. We're going to go through the
        game, what the possibility of a lineup might look like. We got some team news earlier from Enzo Moresca. So,
        we're a little bit more clear on the likes of Cole Palmer's situation, which of course was a massive talking
        point ahead of this one. You don't want to go into a game of this much magnitude without your talisman Cole
        Palmer, but it may be the case. We are going to have to, but we'll make do somehow. There there always is a way,
        guys. So, if you're new to the channel, welcome. Please hit the like button if you enjoy this video, and of
        course, hit the subscribe button. Really helps the channel out. Let me know your thoughts as I take you through
        mine. But as you can see by the smile that hasn't left my face, I'm so excited for this contest. I think when it
        comes to expectations and what team will turn up against this Barcelona side who we know has so much firepower,
        so much history, rich history in this competition of course and is on a wave of them themselves of really good
        football. They've had some good results. So, I think it's my earring just fell off. Um, I think it's so exciting
        to get to test ourselves against a team that's doing so well. Like us, they're coming off the back of a win uh
        in the league against Atletville Bao 4-nil against the 10-man side, but I think they were 3-0 up before the red
        card anyway. So, they were already on course for an emphatic win. They are back at the camp new as well. So,
        it's a really exciting time for them. There's quite a positive vibe. Um, they have some key players coming back
        as well. And when you've got the likes of Laminia Ma who we'll get to see at Stamford Bridge tomorrow. Uh of
        course Robert Levenski who has an absolute incredible history in the tournament as well himself. You've got the
        likes of Famine Lopez who's doing so great for Anne Torres. You have Pedri who's not going to be uh in the
        contention for a start because he's injured. So I guess like for like when it comes to an instrumental player
        missing uh both for us and for Barcelona. uh Rafini is back from injury have Marcus Rashford who's had a good
        start and certainly had a couple good goals himself in the Champions League. So there is a lot of goals across
        the whole team and when you look at the fact that we have maybe struggled at times to uh contain front lines who
        do come at us quite ruthlessly and we know Barcelona do deploy a high line. So we will obviously have space to
        work with as well which is again uh a sort of environment we thrive in a lot more. So I'm hoping that you know
        we can be um we can have strength in that regard but there will certainly be a lot of difficulties. I think
        there's a lot of excitement at the individual matchups the whole across the whole pitch which will be uh real
        interesting for the neutral as well especially but it means we get to test again like I said earlier our players
        against some of the very best out there at the moment so real positive either way and I think even if Chelsea
        don't come away um with a win from this one I think to go up against Barcelona and certainly put in a good shift
        um play with some self-esteem and put on a good show and a performance that we can be proud of And that is also
        a massive uh stepping stone in the right direction. Uh in terms of our um head-to-head of course uh we played
        Barcelona last I think about seven years ago now and it was I think it was like 3-1 or 4-1 across the two legs.
        So um it ended in the round of 16. But before that we go back to our first Champions League win and definitely
        probably the most iconic campaign we have had. Everybody remembers it's Fernando Torres, of course, who we draw
        to in that game. Uh well, we we are drawn to mostly to talk about in that game because of what he did for us.
        So, you're talking absolutely iconic stuff. Um so, it'll be really really interesting. I think to the fan base,
        both fan bases, this time means a lot. And I don't doubt, regardless of how quiet Stamford Bridge has been in
        this season or the last few years, I'd say I don't doubt there's going to be an atmosphere at Stamford Bridge.
        It's going to be great and hopefully we can be treated to an equally exciting contest. So without further ado,
        let's talk about the team. Enzo Moresca is quite unpredictable in his setups. We've seen a lot of rotation and a
        lot of different pairings particularly in defense and the center back dur which seems to change quite
        frequently. Um and we are yet to kind of discover a very sustainable duo that we can count count on game in game
        out but I think what we have seen is that we are quite settled in our sort of fullbacks and we know that I say
        Lucare who is Lucare guys I don't know because I'm thinking about Lemia Mao against Mark Korea. So that's where
        I got Luke McCrae from, I guess. But Mark McCrae, of course, our undisputed starting left back. He has been
        incredible. We know what he's capable of. He's already come toe-to-toe with the best wingers in the world. And
        this is certainly going to be another test for him uh coming up against his compatriate Lmin who is absolutely
        on fire and certainly has enjoyed uh some very very quick rising in his career as a player. So that's going to
        be a very very enticing matchup there. Marco career has shown he's quite reliable and he's so crucial in our
        offensive play as well as our defensive. I think maybe a bigger um sort of focus and emphasis will be on his
        defending particularly one-on-one against the likes of Ramino Mau who is just yeah he's he's a goal machine. He
        is so creative. He can set up his teammates. He can do everything. Great at dribbling, lots of flare. So someone
        that is definitely going to cause us a lot of threats. So Mark Curry is going to have a big job of containing
        him, but I don't doubt his uh his strengths and I'm sure that with the qualities he has shown us that he can do
        a pretty good job. He was obviously asked about it in the press conference earlier today and while he didn't
        come out with this massive self-esteem because of course it would be silly too. Um you know he he he knows what
        he's capable of. He's done it for club and country. So, I think that will be a really good contest there. Um,
        throwing over to the other fullback is an interesting one because we've seen Moresca deploy uh Malagusta or Ree
        Ree James into midfield in some of our bigger games and it does leave us a little bit vulnerable sometimes on
        that right hand side when that does happen. I guess it offers a little bit more physicality and a little bit
        more legs in midfield and obviously coming up against Barcelona. Uh that is going to be pretty much one of the
        key battles there in that game. Midfield certainly. So I think it'll be interesting to see. Um I've seen a lot
        of discourse about this and some may opt for perhaps Ree James to start at right back. So maybe in midfield or
        vice versa or maybe not at all. Um which could perhaps be the less likely option. I'd be intrigued to find out
        your thoughts, but that is definitely going to be one of the question marks there. And when we do talk about
        question marks and we do talk about how we set up, this is the thing about Chelsea is we're so unpredictable and
        I'm sure if Hansy Flick is sitting there trying to sus out how Mesa sets us up against them, he's probably in a
        million minds about this and is going through so many different scenarios because we never know how this Chelsea
        team sets up and it is always intrigue and almost a surprise to us fans as well. So if we don't know then how do
        they know? I just don't think they do. So it's h really interesting to see how um we set up in midfield as well.
        Of course Moyes Cedo luckily was rested for the whole course of the 90 minutes against Burnley. So he's going to
        come on with fresh legs. He's going to be match ready. Definitely all eyes on him. Moes Cedo is certainly on an
        absolute wave right now. He is so so great for us. so instrumental and when you look at importance and you look
        at what he adds to us and when you talk about absence as well certainly a player that you absolutely cannot
        operate with operate without right now so Moses Kedo is going to be so crucial uh in this game uh we saw Enzo
        Fernandez involved uh in the goal scoring as well against Burnley I think I saw a stat that he's now the
        midfield in the Premier League with the most goals from open play from last season so that's just a great stat
        from him as well certainly um open to a bit more criticism and divides opinion in the fan base, but I think Enzo
        Fernandez is a very crucial player and if he's at his best against Barcelona, you're talking about someone who
        can make a real big difference for us. So hopefully if we see a top of his game, Enzo Fernandez, that's a real
        big advantage for us. And um we know what the pair of them can do. Um there's been arguments for Andre Santos to
        perhaps be that extra body in midfield as well who had an absolutely stunning performance against Burnley. Won
        himself a man of the match deservingly. He was everywhere with the interceptions, tackles. He was uh so great
        for us and he took his opportunity to start wonderfully. Is it a big ass though to throw him into this Champions
        League game after he's only been getting like I don't know a few cameos here and there and only a full game at
        the weekend. So perhaps it is maybe a big ask uh to do that. Again, let me know what you think in the comments
        down below. Is Santos a player you start in this game? Um I'm particularly a little bit hesitant with that. So I
        don't know. Let me know what you think. Um so yeah, it doesn't the the um options and the unpredictability
        doesn't stop in our attack either because Garnacho was rested. He didn't make an appearance. We saw Neta
        obviously play uh we had the likes of Jal Pedro. Liam Dilap was there but there has been a little bit of concern
        regarding Dilap and Jal Pedro equally they haven't really been able to form much chemistry but then again Dap's
        been out. Ja Pedro has been into different positions and while many don't favor him as the so-called number
        nine, he has also struggled in the 10 as well. And for me, Joel Pedro is quite slow in terms of obviously pace.
        Um, he is obviously great technically. We saw him have some great shots at the club world cup. So, I think if we
        have that player there, that's great. But for me, if you start Pedro, and I think Enzo Moresque will, you're
        potentially taking out a little bit case which I think against this Barcelona team you need and therefore I'm
        not quite sure how that dynamic plays out. So if we are to say Enzo Moresa arrested Garnacho because he starts
        out on the left wing then that would make sense because again you're talking about quite a a quick winger who
        can get into pockets who can definitely take on um his man and also perhaps offer uh a little bit more
        defensively. So I think Garnacho probably does start in this game. Um, it's quite hard to drop Pedro Netto. And
        if you're in Moresca's mind, then that's a that's not a possibility. And this is where the dilemma comes for me
        because as a Chelsea fan, I would love to see Estal start in this game. He's been managed well. He's been eased
        in slowly. He's had some absolutely brilliant cameos and some very important goals. Has been involved in the
        Champions League. So, it's not to say that this is going to be completely new territory to him. He obviously got
        his goal at Stanford Bridge as well. So I think this is a perfect opportunity for him. You know, this is a a
        massive talking point when you got Barcelona with the likes of Lamin Mau. We've got Esau who is our wonder kid.
        Of course, so much less experience and many many many less high-profile games uh that Laminiah Mau has had. So
        um you know, but you don't halt a player's momentum and right now Esteal has got that momentum. He was great for
        Brazil over international break. He has been so great for us when he's played. So, for me, that's a lot of pace,
        creativity, and technicality. Even though he's young, I think it could be a really, really great um little
        dynamic there to have. So, again, I don't know if Maresa is brave enough to throw Esta in there. And if he
        doesn't, then we probably do see Garnacho and Pedro Netto start because it's hard to leave them out. Um, and
        then, yeah, I think it is really important to obviously have an out andout number nine like as Barcelona will.
        Um, I think it is so important because, you know, you see the likes of Liam Dilap who is and can be great uh
        when he comes out sort of one-on-one. He can create opportunities of his own. He's quite strong and I think you
        need that little bit of strength. Um, Mark G was obviously brilliant in his cameo when he came on was involved
        for the Burnley uh goal as well. So, he is obviously exasser as well. Um, and there's been a little bit of talk
        about him as well, but I don't think Mark uh G would start in this game. So, perhaps Liam Dap definitely proving
        to do. So this is a game where you can do the proving and you can let the the talking be done on the pitch. You
        can show what you can do. So I think it is quite important we do have dilap. For me the biggest concern is will
        they link up well with Pedro if he is to start just behind him or will Mesca opt to start J Pedro up top which I
        don't think is also the cause. So again you can see me trying to go through this lineup and I absolutely just
        don't know what what to think or what to do. Um so yeah I don't know. I'm I'm intrigued and I guess
        unpredictability. It probably goes the same to say for Barcelona because I mean they're sort of intrigued to see
        maybe if Rafen will start. He's obviously back from injury, got a few minutes, but then you know you got the
        likes of Marcus Rashford who has also uh had some important Champions League goals and has enjoyed some good
        form. So, um that's certainly interesting. But, you know, you've got some ridiculously stupidly good players in
        that side. And you know, you look at someone like Lopez who's got, I think, like 12 goal 12 goals and assists in
        13 games or 11 goals and assist in 12 games, something ridiculous like that. And I think that's just
        unbelievable. So yeah, guys, I mean, it's exciting. I'm really excited to see this play out at Stamford Bridge,
        of course. I think, you know, we're yet to see what this Chelsea side can do. We are obviously second in the
        Premier League and we are in uh in treat for a top of the table clash at the weekend against Arsenal. But before
        that we obviously have Barcelona to be tested against. Um but this is what we wish for guys. These are the games
        that we prayed for. Um we have gone from winning the Conference League and playing those games to now coming up
        against the likes of Barcelona. So, I think it will be incredibly amazing to just try and put on a good show,
        put on a good performance and hopefully try and do something. There is a lot of confidence and I hear it. I of
        course always want to back Chelsea. Uh we absolutely are capable though of of winning this game if we are are at
        our best and we take our chances well. I think it would be really naive to say we don't concede because
        Barcelona have pretty much been scoring left, right, and center. And again, we do present teams with
        opportunities, but it's not like it's impossible to score against them as well. They obviously played out a 3-3
        draw against Club Rouge and they had to equalize three times. So, they were clawing their way back into that
        game. And I think overall across the four match weeks we have had in the Champions League. We've both won two,
        drawn one, and lost one. And I think we're literally next to each other in the table as well. So, it's really
        important if we want some direct qualification right in there to kind of uh you know throw ourselves straight in
        there, but I think yeah, it's going to be tough certainly, but we have the advantage of being at home and
        hopefully that could play into uh our hands a little bit. Let me know your score predictions and your thoughts
        down below. What lineups would you start? Who would start? Do you think there's any chance that Cole Palmer just
        sneaks into the bench and just says, "Haha, guys, I was joking. I'm not really hurt because I would just pray
        for that to be the case. Um, but either way, we have the uh resources there. We absolutely do. I think it's just
        about going there, executing our plan, and hopefully, fingers crossed, Chelsea can get a result against
        Barcelona. Thank you so much for watching, guys. If you enjoyed the video, then please hit the like button.
